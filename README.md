# C Image Conversion and Manipulation Tool
## Project Overview
This project is a simplified version of an image manipulation tool inspired by the open-source project convert. The tool is implemented in C and supports reading and writing images in the P3 Portable Pixmap (PPM) format, performing basic image manipulations (such as rotation, mirroring, and resizing), and executing a flood-fill operation. This project showcases fundamental image processing techniques and the use of basic data structures in C.

## Features
### Reading and Writing Image Files:
Supports the P3 PPM format, reading and writing images with a maximum color value of 255.
### Simple Image Manipulation: 
Includes functions to rotate images (clockwise and counterclockwise), mirror images (horizontally and vertically), and resize images with cropping or padding.
### Flood-Fill Algorithm:
Implements a 4-directional flood-fill algorithm, similar to the paint bucket tool in image editing software.
### Graphical User Interface (GUI):
A simple GUI to test and visualize the implemented image manipulations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To work with this project, you will need:

A C compiler that supports the GNU Make build system.
Basic knowledge of C programming and image file formats.
